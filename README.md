# 🎓 CodeAlpha Data Science Internship
This repository contains the projects and tasks completed during my 1-month Data Science Internship at CodeAlpha. 
The internship focused on practical applications of Python, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis.

## 📁 Repository Structure
Each folder contains the dataset, Jupyter Notebook, and specific documentation for the respective task.

## 🚀 Tasks Overview

### 1. Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning 🌸
Goal: Classify Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using sepal and petal measurements.

Key Techniques: Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree Classifier, Train-Test Split, Model Evaluation.

Outcome: Achieved 100% accuracy on test data with both KNN and Decision Tree models, confirming highly separable classes in the classic Iris dataset.

Status: ✅ Completed

### 2. Unemployment Analysis in India
Goal: Analyze unemployment trends across Indian states, with a focus on the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown and recovery patterns.

Key Techniques: Data cleaning (null handling, date parsing), Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Statistical summaries, Visualization.

Outcome: Revealed sharp unemployment spikes during the 2020 lockdown (peaking above 20% nationally), identified hardest-hit states, and showed partial recovery post-lockdown with regional variations.

Status: ✅ Completed

### 3. Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
Goal: Predict the selling price of used cars based on features like present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, and car age.

Key Techniques: Feature engineering, One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables, multiple regression models, hyperparameter tuning, Pipeline integration, model evaluation with R² score.

Outcome: Built a high-performing predictive model with a reusable pipeline, saved for deployment, and demonstrated accurate price estimation.

Status: ✅ Completed

### 4. Sales Prediction using Python (Task 4)
Goal: Predict product sales based on advertising budgets (TV, Radio, Newspaper).

Key Techniques: Linear Regression, Correlation Analysis, Feature Selection.

Outcome: Achieved a 90% R-squared score, identifying Radio as the most efficient ROI driver and TV as the highest volume driver.

Status: ✅ Completed


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: Python 3.x

Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn
