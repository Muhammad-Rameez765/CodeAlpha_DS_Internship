# 🎓 CodeAlpha Data Science Internship
This repository contains the projects and tasks completed during my 1-month Data Science Internship at CodeAlpha. 
The internship focused on practical applications of Python, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis.

## 📁 Repository Structure
Each folder contains the dataset, Jupyter Notebook, and specific documentation for the respective task.

## 🚀 Tasks Overview
### 1. Sales Prediction using Python (Task 4)
Goal: Predict product sales based on advertising budgets (TV, Radio, Newspaper).

Key Techniques: Linear Regression, Correlation Analysis, Feature Selection.

Outcome: Achieved a 90% R-squared score, identifying Radio as the most efficient ROI driver and TV as the highest volume driver.

Status: ✅ Completed


### 2. Titanic Classification (Task 1)
Goal: Build a system to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

Key Techniques: Data Imputation, Handling Categorical Variables, Random Forest/Logistic Regression.

Outcome: Successfully mapped passenger demographics (age, class, gender) to survival probability.

Status: ✅ Completed


### 3. Stock Price Prediction (Task 2)
Goal: Forecast future stock prices using historical market data.

Key Techniques: Time Series Analysis, Moving Averages, LSTM or Linear Regression.

Outcome: Developed a model to visualize market trends and predict price movements based on closing price history.

Status: ✅ Completed


### 4. Credit Card Fraud Detection (Task 3)
Goal: Identify fraudulent credit card transactions to protect customers from unauthorized charges.

Key Techniques: Handling Imbalanced Data (SMOTE), Precision-Recall Curves, Random Forest Classifier.

Outcome: Created a high-precision model capable of distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

Status: ✅ Completed

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: Python 3.x

Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab / Kaggle

## 📊 Summary of Learnings
Data Cleaning: Real-world data is messy; I learned to handle missing values and outliers effectively.

Model Selection: Understanding when to use Regression vs. Classification.

Evaluation: Using metrics like MAE, RMSE, Accuracy, and F1-Score to validate model reliability.

Communication: Presenting technical findings as actionable business insights.
