## 🚀 Overview
The analysis covers the period leading up to and during the first wave of COVID-19. By cleaning and visualizing monthly labor statistics, we aim to identify the depth of the employment crisis and the subsequent recovery patterns.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Kaggle

## 📊 Key Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and standardizing date formats.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying trends in the "Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)" and "Labour Participation Rate (%)".
- **Impact Visualization:** Using time-series plots to mark significant events like the start of lockdowns.
- **Regional Analysis:** Comparing how different states and areas (Rural vs. Urban) were affected.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains the raw CSV datasets.
- `notebooks/`: The main `.ipynb` file with the full analysis code.
- `Insights.md`: A detailed report covering the project's storytelling, objectives, and Q&A.

## 📈 Results
Our findings highlight a sharp spike in unemployment during April-May 2020, where national rates exceeded 20% due to business closures and restrictions.
